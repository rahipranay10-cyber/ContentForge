## What is ContextForge?

ContextForge is a Chrome extension that lets you **capture AI conversation context once and reuse it across any AI platform** — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Mistral, and more. Built as a fully open-source, zero-cost alternative to Capsule Hub.

🧠 **One capture. Every AI. Zero friction.**

| Works on Grok | No | **Yes** |
| Works on DeepSeek | Limited | **Yes** |
| Works on any AI site | No | **Yes (universal)** |
| Edit capsules (clear UI) | Confusing | **Simple, clear form** |
| Permissions | High-risk (reads your Gmail, Outlook) | **Minimal — no email access** |

| Export data | Limited | **Full JSON export/import** |
| Team sharing | Paid | **Export JSON and share freely** |
